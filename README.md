# Time Series Analysis and Prediction
Using Deep Learning and RNN/LSTM for Time Series Learning and Prediction

### Problem Description
The task is to predict the number of international airline passengers in units of 1,000. The data ranges from January 1949 to December 1960, or 12 years, with 144 observations.

The dataset is available for free from the DataMarket webpage as a CSV download with the filename "international-airline-passengers.csv".


```python
import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1st column of csv file is "date" which we don't need. And 3 footer lines can also be skipped.
dataset = pandas.read_csv('international-airline-passengers.csv', usecols=[1], engine='python', skipfooter=3)

plt.plot(dataset)
plt.show()
```

### LSTM Network for Regression

We can phrase the problem as a regression problem.

That is, given the number of passengers (in units of thousands) this month, what is the number of passengers next month?

We can write a simple function to convert our single column of data into a two-column dataset: the first column containing this month's (t) passenger count and the second column containing next month's (t+1) passenger count, to be predicted.

Before we get started, let's first import all of the functions and classes we intend to use. This assumes a working SciPy environment with the Keras deep learning library installed.


```python
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas
import math
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.layers import LSTM
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

    Using TensorFlow backend.
    

Before we do anything, it is a good idea to fix the random number seed to ensure our results are reproducible.


```python
# fix random seed for reproducibility
seed = numpy.random.seed(7)
```

We can also use the code from the previous section to load the dataset as a Pandas dataframe. We can then extract the NumPy array from the dataframe and convert the integer values to floating point values, which are more suitable for modeling with a neural network.


```python
# load the dataset
filename = 'shampoo-sales.csv'
#filename = 'international-airline-passengers.csv'
skipfooter = 2
dataframe = pandas.read_csv(filename, usecols=[1], engine='python', skipfooter=skipfooter)
dataset = dataframe.values
dataset = dataset.astype('float32')
```

LSTMs are sensitive to the scale of the input data, specifically when the sigmoid (default) or tanh activation functions are used. It can be a good practice to rescale the data to the range of 0-to-1, also called normalizing. We can easily normalize the dataset using the **MinMaxScaler** preprocessing class from the scikit-learn library.


```python
# normalize the dataset
data_range = (-1, 1)
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=data_range)        # scaler can also de-normalize the dataset by scaler.inverse_transform(), useful for actual prediction
dataset_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(dataset)
#dataset_scaled = numpy.array(dataset_scaled)
```


```python
print(dataset_scaled.shape)
print(len(dataset_scaled))
print(dataset_scaled[0:10])
```

    (36, 1)
    36
    [[-0.47858536]
     [-0.90545583]
     [-0.7732361 ]
     [-0.99999994]
     [-0.78318816]
     [-0.82512879]
     [-0.60014212]
     [-0.62608844]
     [-0.73875952]
     [-0.98720449]]
    

After we model our data and estimate the skill of our model on the training dataset, we need to get an idea of the skill of the model on new unseen data. For a normal classification or regression problem, we would do this using cross validation.

With time series data, the sequence of values is important. A simple method that we can use is to split the ordered dataset into train and test datasets. The code below calculates the index of the split point and separates the data into the training datasets with 67% of the observations that we can use to train our model, leaving the remaining 33% for testing the model.


```python
# split into train and test sets
train_size = int(len(dataset_scaled) * 0.67)
test_size = len(dataset_scaled) - train_size
train, test = dataset_scaled[0:train_size,:], dataset_scaled[train_size:len(dataset),:]
print(len(train), len(test))
```

Now we can define a function to create a new dataset, as described above.

The function takes two arguments: the **dataset**, which is a NumPy array that we want to convert into a dataset, and the **look_back**, which is the number of previous time steps to use as input variables to predict the next time period in this case defaulted to 1.

This default will create a dataset where X is the number of passengers at a given time (t) and Y is the number of passengers at the next time (t + 1).

It can be configured, and we will by constructing a differently shaped dataset in the next section.


```python
# convert an array of values into a dataset matrix
def create_dataset(data, look_back=1):
    dataX, dataY = [], []
    i_range = len(data) - look_back - 1
    print(i_range)
    for i in range(0, i_range):
        dataX.append(data[i:(i+look_back)])    # index can move down to len(dataset)-1
        dataY.append(data[i + look_back])      # Y is the item that skips look_back number of items
    
    return numpy.array(dataX), numpy.array(dataY)
```


```python
# try it
look_back = 4
dataX, dataY = create_dataset(dataset_scaled, look_back=look_back)
```

    31
    


```python
print("X shape:", dataX.shape)
print("Y shape:", dataY.shape)
   
print("Xt-3     Xt-2      Xt-1      Xt        Y")
print("---------------------------------------------")
for i in range(len(dataX)): 
    print('%.2f   %.2f    %.2f    %.2f    %.2f' % (dataX[i][0][0], dataX[i][1][0], dataX[i][2][0], dataX[i][3][0], dataY[i][0]))
```

```python
# Reshape to (samples, timestep, features)
dataX = numpy.reshape(dataX, (dataX.shape[0], 1, dataX.shape[1]))

print("X shape:", dataX.shape)

```

    X shape: (31, 1, 4)
    

Let's use this function to prepare the train and test datasets for modeling.


```python
# reshape into X=t and Y=t+1
look_back = 1
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train, look_back)      # trainX is input, trainY is expected output
testX, testY = create_dataset(test, look_back)
```

The LSTM network expects the input data (X) to be provided with a specific array structure in the form of 3D: **[samples, time steps, features]**, or in other words, 3D tensor with shape **(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)**, or optionally,  2D tensors with shape  **(batch_size, output_dim)**.

Currently, our data is in the form: [samples, features] and we are framing the problem as one time step for each sample. We can transform the prepared train and test input data into the expected structure using **numpy.reshape()** as follows:


```python
# reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]
print("Original trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
trainX = numpy.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], look_back, trainX.shape[1]))     # timestep = 1, input_dim = trainX.shape[1]
testX = numpy.reshape(testX, (testX.shape[0], look_back, testX.shape[1]))
print("New trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
print("trainY shape:", trainY.shape)
print("trainY example:", trainY[0])
```

    Original trainX shape: (22, 1, 1)
    New trainX shape: (22, 1, 1)
    trainY shape: (22, 1)
    trainY example: [-0.90545583]
    

We are now ready to design and fit our LSTM network for this problem.

The network has a visible layer with 1 input, a hidden layer with 4 LSTM blocks or neurons, and an output layer that makes a single value prediction. The default sigmoid activation function is used for the LSTM blocks. The network is trained for 100 epochs and a batch size of 1 is used.

Once the model is fit, we can estimate the performance of the model on the train and test datasets. This will give us a point of comparison for new models.

Note that we invert the predictions before calculating error scores to ensure that performance is reported in the same units as the original data (thousands of passengers per month).


```python
# make predictions
trainPredict = model.predict(trainX, batch_size)
testPredict = model.predict(testX, batch_size)      

# invert predictions
trainPredict = scaler.inverse_transform(trainPredict)
trainY = scaler.inverse_transform(trainY)               # trainY is of shape (samples, features) while trainX is of (samples, timesteps, features) )
testPredict = scaler.inverse_transform(testPredict)
testY = scaler.inverse_transform(testY)

print("trainY shape:", trainY.shape)
print("trainPredict shape:", trainPredict.shape)
print("testY shape:", testY.shape)
print("testPredict shape:", testPredict.shape)

# calculate root mean squared error
trainScore = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(trainY, trainPredict))
print('Train Score: %.2f RMSE' % (trainScore))
testScore = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(testY, testPredict))
print('Test Score: %.2f RMSE' % (testScore))
```

    trainY shape: (22, 1)
    trainPredict shape: (22, 1)
    testY shape: (10, 1)
    testPredict shape: (10, 1)
    Train Score: 70.67 RMSE
    Test Score: 245.28 RMSE
    

Finally, we can generate predictions using the model for both the train and test dataset to get a visual indication of the skill of the model.

Because of how the dataset was prepared, we must shift the predictions so that they align on the x-axis with the original dataset (because the output Y is 1 timestep shift from input X). Once prepared, the data is plotted, showing the original dataset in blue, the predictions for the training dataset in green, and the predictions on the unseen test dataset in red.


```python
# shift train predictions for plotting
trainPredictPlot = numpy.empty_like(dataset)
trainPredictPlot[:, :] = numpy.nan
#print(trainPredictPlot[0])
trainPredictPlot[look_back:len(trainPredict)+look_back, :] = trainPredict

# shift test predictions for plotting
testPredictPlot = numpy.empty_like(dataset)
testPredictPlot[:, :] = numpy.nan
testPredictPlot[len(trainPredict)+(look_back*2)+1:len(dataset)-1, :] = testPredict

```


```python
# plot baseline and predictions
plt.plot(scaler.inverse_transform(dataset_scaled))
#plt.plot(dataset_scaled)
plt.plot(trainPredictPlot)
plt.plot(testPredictPlot)
plt.show()
```

### LSTM for Regression Using the Window Method

We can also phrase the problem so that multiple, recent time steps can be used to make the prediction for the next time step.

This is called a window, and the size of the window is a parameter that can be tuned for each problem.

For example, given the current time (t) we want to predict the value at the next time in the sequence (t+1), we can use the current time (t), as well as the two prior times (t-1 and t-2) as input variables.

When phrased as a regression problem, the input variables are t-2, t-1, t and the output variable is t+1.

The **create_dataset()** function we created in the previous section allows us to create this formulation of the time series problem by increasing the look_back argument from 1 to 3.


```python
# reshape into X=t-2, t-1. t, and Y=t+1
look_back = 4
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train, look_back)      # trainX is input, trainY is expected output
testX, testY = create_dataset(test, look_back)

# reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]
print("Original trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
print("Original testX shape:", testX.shape)

trainX = numpy.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], 1, trainX.shape[1]))    # input_dim = trainX.shape[1] = 4
testX = numpy.reshape(testX, (testX.shape[0], 1, testX.shape[1]))

print("New trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
print("New testX shape:", testX.shape)
print("trainY shape:", trainY.shape)
print("trainY example:", trainY[0])
```

### LSTM for Regression with Time Steps

You may have noticed that the data preparation for the LSTM network includes time steps.

Some sequence problems may have a varied number of time steps per sample. For example, you may have measurements of a physical machine leading up to a point of failure or a point of surge. Each incident would be a sample the observations that lead up to the event would be the time steps, and the variables observed would be the features.

Time steps provide another way to phrase our time series problem. Like above in the window example, we can take prior time steps in our time series as inputs to predict the output at the next time step.

Instead of phrasing the past observations as separate input features, we can use them as time steps of the one input feature, which is indeed a more accurate framing of the problem.

We can do this using the same data representation as in the previous window-based example, except when we reshape the data, we set the columns to be the time steps dimension (timesteps is not 1 anymore) and change the features dimension back to 1. Note that input_shape of the model is changed as well.


```python
# reshape X into 4 timesteps for one feature vector (Xt-3, Xt-2, Xt-1, Xt), with expected output Y at t
look_back = 4
timesteps = 4
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train, look_back)      # trainX is input, trainY is expected output (label)
testX, testY = create_dataset(test, look_back)

# reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]
print("Original trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
print("Original testX shape:", testX.shape)
trainX = numpy.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], trainX.shape[1], 1))   # samples = trainX.shape[0], timesteps = trainX.shape[1], features = 1
testX = numpy.reshape(testX, (testX.shape[0], testX.shape[1], 1))
print("New trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
print("New testX shape:", testX.shape)
print("trainY shape:", trainY.shape)
print("trainY example:", trainY[0])
```

timesteps = trainX.shape[1]
# my_init = keras.initializers.RandomNormal(mean=0.0, stddev=0.05, seed=seed)
#model.add(LSTM(8, input_shape=(look_back, 1)))    # 4 or 8 is the number of LSTM units or dimensions of output of LSTM layer, can be any integer. input_shape must show up in the first layer
model.add(LSTM(8, batch_input_shape=(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)))  # input_dim = 1
model.add(Dense(10))    # may not be necessary, but just want to try it
#model.add(Dropout(0.8))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=50, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=2)   # it turns out that epochs = 15 is enough, 100 is not necessary

### LSTM with Memory Between Batches

The LSTM network has memory, which is capable of remembering across long sequences.

Normally, the state within the network is reset after each training batch when fitting the model, as well as each call to **model.predict()** or **model.evaluate()**.

We can gain finer control over when the internal state of the LSTM network is cleared in Keras by making the LSTM layer **stateful**. This means that it can build state over the entire training sequence and even maintain that state if needed to make predictions.

*Jiyang's note: "state" is what one unit sends to the next units or itself (i.e. memory), which is different from weights and outputs.*

It requires that the training data **not be shuffled** when fitting the network. It also requires explicit resetting of the network state after each exposure to the training data (epoch) by calls to **model.reset_states()**. This means that we must create our own outer loop of epochs and within each epoch call **model.fit()** and **model.reset_states()**. 

*Jiyang's note: I set shuffle=True in model.fit and unexpectedly got better test accuracy vs. shuffle=False (43 vs. 72) as I thought shuffle or not doesn't matte when batch_size = 1. *


```python
# reshape into 4 timesteps for one feature (Xt-3, Xt-2, Xt-1, Xt), with expected output Y at t
look_back = 4
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train, look_back)      # trainX is input, trainY is expected output
testX, testY = create_dataset(test, look_back)

# reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]

### Stacked LSTMs with Memory Between Batches

Finally, we will take a look at one of the big benefits of LSTMs: the fact that they can be successfully trained when stacked into deep network architectures.

LSTM networks can be stacked in Keras in the same way that other layer types can be stacked. One addition to the configuration that is required is that an LSTM layer prior to each subsequent LSTM layer must return the sequence. This can be done by setting the **return_sequences** parameter on the layer to **True**.

Jiyang's note: just like ConvNet, better performance can be obtained when the number of LSTM units in higher layer is higher than (not even equal to) that in the lower layer.


```python
# reshape into 4 timesteps for one feature (Xt-3, Xt-2, Xt-1, Xt), with expected output Y at t
look_back = 4
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train, look_back)      # trainX is input, trainY is expected output
testX, testY = create_dataset(test, look_back)

# reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]
print("Original trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
print("Original testX shape:", testX.shape)
trainX = numpy.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], trainX.shape[1], 1))
testX = numpy.reshape(testX, (testX.shape[0], testX.shape[1], 1))
print("New trainX shape:", trainX.shape)
print("New testX shape:", testX.shape)
print("trainY shape:", trainY.shape)
print("trainY example:", trainY[0])
```

### Persistence Model Forecast - Baseline

A good baseline forecast for a time series with a linear increasing trend is a persistence forecast.

The persistence forecast is where the observation from the prior time step (t-1) is used to predict the observation at the current time step (t).

We can implement this by taking the last observation from the training data and history accumulated by walk-forward validation and using that to predict the current time step.


```python
from pandas import read_csv
from pandas import datetime
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from math import sqrt
from matplotlib import pyplot

# load dataset

def parser(x):
	return datetime.strptime('201'+x, '%Y-%m')   # add year to months, and using format yyyy-mm

series = read_csv('shampoo-sales.csv', engine='python', delimiter = ',', index_col=0, header=0, parse_dates=[0], skipfooter=2, squeeze=True, skip_blank_lines=True, date_parser=parser)
# skipfooter = 2 must be added so that the last two rows (an empty row and a footer row) will not be converted to 201y-mm, which also requires engine='python'
print("series shape:", series.shape)
print(series.head())

# line plot
series.plot()
pyplot.show()

```

### LSTM Data Preparation

Before we can fit an LSTM model to the dataset, we must transform the data.

This section is broken down into three steps:

- Transform the time series into a supervised learning problem
- Transform the time series data so that it is stationary.
- Transform the observations to have a specific scale.

#### Transform Time Series to Supervised Learning

The LSTM model in Keras assumes that your data is divided into input (X) and output (y) components.

For a time series problem, we can achieve this by using the observation from the last time step (t-1) as the input and the observation at the current time step (t) as the output.

We can achieve this using the **shift()** function in Pandas that will push all values in a series down by a specified number places. We require a shift of 1 place, which will become the input variables. The time series as it stands will be the output variables.

We can then concatenate these two series together to create a DataFrame ready for supervised learning. The pushed-down series will have a new position at the top with no value. A NaN (not a number) value will be used in this position. We will replace these NaN values with 0 values, which the LSTM model will have to learn as the start of the series or have no data here, such as a month with zero sales on this dataset has not been observed.

The code below defines a helper function to do this called **timeseries_to_supervised()**. It takes a NumPy array of the raw time series data and a lag or number of shifted series to create and use as inputs.


```python
from pandas import read_csv
from pandas import datetime
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas import concat

def timeseries_to_supervised(data, lag=1):
    """Frame a sequence data into a supervised learning problem, i.e., time sequence -> (X, y)"""
    df = DataFrame(data)               # DataFrame is a pandas class
    columns = [df.shift(i) for i in range(1, lag+1)]   # shift() pushed dataframe or a column vector downwards by i spaces
    columns.append(df)      # append the original as the output y onto the last column
    df = concat(columns, axis=1)
    df.fillna(0, inplace=True)   # turn NaN to 0
    return df
```


```python
X = series.values
lags = 4
supervised = timeseries_to_supervised(X, lag = lags)
print(supervised.head())
```

    4  119.3  183.1  145.9  266.0  180.3
    


```python

print("Original row:\n", dataset[0:5])

X = X[0:-1]
print("\nShape of X:", X.shape)

X, y = X[:,0:-1], X[:, -1]
rows, cols = X.shape
X = X.reshape(rows, 1, cols)   # [samples, timestep, features]
print("\nX reshaped to 3D:\n",X)

#### Transform Time Series to Stationary

The Shampoo Sales dataset is not stationary.

This means that there is a structure in the data that is dependent on the time. Specifically, there is an increasing trend in the data.

*Jiyang's comment: is the trend what we'd like the model to capture?*

Stationary data is easier to model and will very likely result in more skillful forecasts.

The trend can be removed from the observations, then added back to forecasts later to return the prediction to the original scale and calculate a comparable error score.

A standard way to remove a trend is by differencing the data. That is the observation from the previous time step (t-1) is subtracted from the current observation (t). This removes the trend and we are left with a difference series, or the changes to the observations from one time step to the next.

We can achieve this automatically using the **diff()** function in pandas. Alternatively, we can get finer grained control and write our own function to do this, which is preferred for its flexibility in this case.

Below is a function called **difference()** that calculates a differenced series. Note that the first observation in the series is skipped as there is no prior observation with which to calculate a differenced value.


```python
# create a differenced series
def difference(dataset, interval=1):
    diff = list()
    for i in range(interval, len(dataset)):
        value = dataset[i] - dataset[i - interval]
        diff.append(value)
    
    # pandas.Series() turns a list like [-120.1, 37.2, ...] to a time series
    return Series(diff)
```

We also need to invert this process in order to take forecasts made on the differenced series back into their original scale, by function  **inverse_difference()**, in which history is the data series used to get diff. Our model predicts diff that is to be converted to original scale by diff + history


```python
# invert differenced value
def inverse_difference(history, diff, interval=1):
    return diff + history[-interval]
```

We can test out these functions by differencing the whole series, then returning it to the original scale, as follows:


```python
from pandas import read_csv
from pandas import datetime
from pandas import Series

differenced = difference(series, interval=1)
print("differenced:")
print(differenced.head())

# invert transform
inverted = list()
for i in range(len(differenced)):
    value = inverse_difference(series, differenced[i], len(series)-i)
    inverted.append(value)
inverted = Series(inverted)
print("\n")
print("Inverted back:")
print(inverted.head())
```

    differenced:
    0   -120.1
    1     37.2
    2    -63.8
    3     61.0
    4    -11.8
    dtype: float64
    
    
    Inverted back:
    0    145.9
    1    183.1
    2    119.3
    3    180.3
    4    168.5
    dtype: float64
    


```python
def diff(dataset, interval=1):
    """My implementation of diff() function, avoiding using "for" loop. """
    history = dataset[0:-interval]
    new_output = dataset[interval:,]
#    print("history")
#    print(history.head())
#    print("\nnew_output")
#    print(new_output.head())
    return new_output - list(history)
```


```python
# invert differenced value

## Seasonal Persistence Forecasting

It is critical to have a useful first-cut forecast on time series problems to provide a lower-bound on skill before moving on to more sophisticated methods.

This is to ensure we are not wasting time on models or datasets that are not predictive.

It is common to use a persistence or a naive forecast as a first-cut forecast model when time series forecasting.

This does not make sense with time series data that has an obvious seasonal component. A better first cut model for seasonal data is to use the observation at the same time in the previous seasonal cycle as the prediction.

We can call this **seasonal persistence** and it is a simple model that can result in an effective first cut model.

One step better is to use a simple function of the last few observations at the same time in previous seasonal cycles. For example, the mean of the observations. This can often provide a small additional benefit.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate this simple seasonal persistence forecasting method for providing a lower bound on forecast skill on three different real-world time series datasets.

### Seasonal Persistence with Sliding Window

In this tutorial, we will use a sliding window seasonal persistence model to make forecasts.

Within a sliding window, observations at the same time (such as same day, same month, etc.) in previous one-year seasons will be collected and the mean of those observations can be used as the persisted forecast (for the same day, month, etc.).

Different window sizes (e.g., same day of the year over the last window=5 years) can be evaluated to find a combination that minimizes error.

As an example, if the data is monthly and the month to be predicted is February, then with a window of size 1 (w=1) the observation last February will be used to make the forecast.

A window of size 2 (w=2) would involve taking observations for the last two Februaries to be averaged and used as a forecast.

An alternate interpretation might seek to use point observations from prior years (e.g. t-12, t-24, etc. for monthly data) rather than taking the mean of the cumulative point observations. Perhaps try both methods on your dataset and see what works best as a good starting point model.


### Experimental Test Harness

It is important to evaluate time series forecasting models consistently.

In this section, we will define how we will evaluate forecast models in this tutorial.

First, we will hold the last two years of data back and evaluate forecasts on this data. This works for both monthly and daily data we will look at.

We will use a **walk-forward validation** to evaluate model performance. This means that each time step in the test dataset will be enumerated, a model constructed on historical data, and the forecast compared to the expected value. The observation will then be added to the training dataset and the process repeated.

Walk-forward validation is a realistic way to evaluate time series forecast models as one would expect models to be updated as new observations are made available.

Finally, forecasts will be evaluated using root mean squared error, or RMSE. The benefit of RMSE is that it penalizes large errors and the scores are in the same units as the forecast values (car sales per month).

In summary, the test harness involves:

- The last 2 years of data used as a test set.
- Walk-forward validation for model evaluation.
- Root mean squared error used to report model skill.
